# Full Stack Web Development
# Open Course - University of Helsinki
This repository is used for submitting my work at an open course: Full Stack Web Development at University of Helsinki.

Each folder corresponds with one part of the course.

For graders: please check the commit timeline, there are some commits I made for doing the exercises of later parts (e.g: I updating the sample solution to part 4 after submitting the answers for doing part 5 more smoothly)
